        <h2>Users</h2>
<p>Here's where administrators can see all users individually listed on cards. Users can be displayed as individual cards or grouped together in decks.</p>

<p>Decks can be customised by location, employment status etc.</br> Any one user can appear in multiple decks eg someone who's unemployed + living in Plymouth could appear in both decks at the administrators discretion</p>
